***Important Note to Instructor*** 
Our initial commit is all done by Daichi Kanasugi becuase the project was originally 
in Daichi Kanasugi's C9 Workspace. On April 29th, the instructor told us that we should
have out codes and work in our own C9 Workspace and push individually to show contribution.
