<b>Project Description</b><br>
This project is a mini video player that uses Google's YouTube API. It retrieves popular and most viewed videos
and people who signed up will have the ability to save the videos they liked and disliked. Users can also
make a playlist from the videos they watched. 

//////***Important Note to Instructor*** //////<br>
Our initial commit is all done by Daichi Kanasugi becuase the project was originally 
in Daichi Kanasugi's C9 Workspace. On April 29th, the instructor told us that we should
have our own codes and stored into our own C9 Workspace. These codes should be pushed
individually to the repository to see individual's contribution. 

<b>These are the files that indivuals have contributed to on Daichi Kanasugi's workspace from the 
initial commit files. </b>
