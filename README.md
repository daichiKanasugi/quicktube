<b>Project Description</b><br>
This project is a mini video player that uses Google's YouTube API. It retrieves popular and searched videos
from Youtube. People who signed up will have the ability to save the videos they liked and be able to put it in their playlist.
The project also records every searched history in from the search bar. 

<b>Important Note to Instructor</b><br>
Our initial commit is all done by Daichi Kanasugi becuase the project was originally 
in Daichi Kanasugi's C9 Workspace. On April 29th, the instructor told us that we should
have our codes and work in our own C9 Workspace and push individually to show contribution. 
<br>
These are the files that indivuals have contributed to on Daichi Kanasugi's workspace from the 
initial commit files.
